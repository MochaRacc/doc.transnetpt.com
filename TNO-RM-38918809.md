**Occupation description:**
Following trials on Stadium Park between May 14th & May 16th, train patronage was more focused at the Cross City group, rather than the Northern & Eastern Groups. 
The tracks connecting both Northern and Eastern Groups will be dismantled, and Stadium Park will re-open to the general public as West Thornsbury again.

No trains will be affected, Avandale & Moorinallea/Midhurst trains will stop at Stadium Park/West Thornsbury from this date onwards.
